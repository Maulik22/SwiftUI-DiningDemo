# SwiftUI-DiningDemo

DiningDemo is a restaurant app that lists items in a menu and helps folks place orders. I’ve designed the project specifically so that it covers as many different techniques as possible to give a good grounding in how things work in SwiftUI.

In this project I’ve tried to expose a number of different things all at once, including lists, stacks, forms, navigation, alerts, and more. Even then there’s still a lot more to cover.
